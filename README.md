# Text Summarization using Seq2Seq in Tensorflow

Implementation of a seq2seq model in Tensorflow for summarization of textual data.

## Prerequisites
- Tensorflow
- nltk
- numpy
- pandas 
- langdetect

## Datasets
I tried the network on "All the news" dataset
- https://www.kaggle.com/snapcrack/all-the-news

## Code 
I uploaded three **.py** and one **.ipynb** file. The .py files contain the network implementation and utilities required for Seq2Seq Model. The notebooks are demos of how to apply the model in use.

## RNN Architecture Summary
**Seq2Seq model**
- Encoder-Decoder
- Bidirectional RNN
- Bahdanau Attention
- Adam Optimizer
- exponential or cyclic learning rate
- Beam Search or Greedy Decoding
